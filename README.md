# BigMath

S# class library for computations with big numbers such as `Int128`, `Int256` and `BigInteger`. There is also `ExtendedBitConverter` which allows to convert regular and big numbers to/from array of bytes, with possibility of explicit setting of bytes order [Big-endian/Little-endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).

Some parts of the code is based on:

1. Original sources from [https://github.com/everbytes/BigMath](https://github.com/everbytes/BigMath) and [http://int128.codeplex.com/](http://int128.codeplex.com/). Thanks to [Simon Mourier](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/view/simonm).
2. `BigInteger` from the [Bouncy Castle](http://www.bouncycastle.org/).
